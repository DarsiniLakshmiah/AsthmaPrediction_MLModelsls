# AsthmaPrediction_MLModelsls
This project predicts the prevalence of current asthma (CASTHMA) across U.S. counties using machine learning models on CDC PLACES data. By combining behavioral, preventive, and spatial features, models like SVR, Gradient Boosting, and GPR were used to achieve high accuracy and interpretability in small-area health outcome predictions.
